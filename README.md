LuxBnb, an AirBnb clone, offers a diverse selection of heavenly destinations for exploration. Users can post their own paradises for others to enjoy, while also having a plethora of options to choose from for their getaways. The platform includes features such as reviews, comments, and booking capabilities.

This is my first ever website clone. All skills were obtained from App Academy.

Technologies used for this project are: Express, Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, Redux, PostgreSQL, GitHub, AWS.
